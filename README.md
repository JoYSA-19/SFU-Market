SFU Market

Preface
------------------------------------
For this Iteration, we have successfully shifted to PHP and MySQL as our backend. The relational database will be helpful for adding features later on. For example, tying textbooks to professors would be easier if multiple teachers have the same textbook and vice versa. Additionally, we are using AWS for hosting our web server so this time, there should not be a need to download any backend code and should simply run with just the frontend code.

Introduction
------------------------------------
The SFU Market application allows for students to easily search for classes and the textbooks they require, removing the need for second-hand marketplaces such as the Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist. The program is intended for users trying to save money and reduce waste by selling old textbooks instead of throwing them out. The users would either be sellers or buyers: sellers would post their products, along with the relevant information (photos, class, ISBN), while buyers would search and buy the product they require...

Installation 
------------------------------------
Grabbing our code off git lab should suffice for this iteration.

Testing
------------------------------------
- Have a valid **emulator** running or test on **your own android device**
