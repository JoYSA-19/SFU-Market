SFU Market

Preface
------------------------------------
For this final sprint, we have added sessions which allows all activites while logged in be under that user. Users are also able to view and click through all posts that have been posted to our app. While we weren't able to implement all features that we had planned, our app is able to do what we originally planned for it to do.

Introduction
------------------------------------
The SFU Market application allows for students to easily search for classes and the textbooks they require, removing the need for second-hand marketplaces such as the Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist. The program is intended for users trying to save money and reduce waste by selling old textbooks instead of throwing them out. The users would either be sellers or buyers: sellers would post their products, along with the relevant information (photos, class, ISBN), while buyers would search and buy the product they require...

Installation 
------------------------------------
